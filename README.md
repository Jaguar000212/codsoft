# CodSoft Internship
I, Shryansh Parashar from Manipal Institute of Technology, Bengaluru, have successfully completed all the tasks give by CodSoft as a part of my internship in C++ Programming starting from 20 January 2024.
I certify that the code is completely mine and there has been no plagiarism.

## Completed Tasks :
- #### Task 1 - Create a Number Guessing Game in C++<br>
  I simply used ctime library to generate the random number. Made high-low hints to make it more interactive.

- #### Task 2 - Create a Simple Calculator in C++<br>
  Took inputs for two numbers from the user and the operator as well, then calculated the result.

- #### Task 4 - To-Do List in C++<br>
  Created the list to which we can add, deleted items. We can save and load the list as well.

Use the `launcher.py` to get an easier access to all of my applications.
